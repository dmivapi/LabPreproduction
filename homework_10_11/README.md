# Hibernate homework:

Based on example 5:
You need to create CRUD service with Entities, DTO, Assemblers, Repositories. 

1. Use your domain model.
2. Use UUID as identifiers.

3. Required relationships: 
    - Bidirectional  One-To-Many (Like in Tourist <--> Journey)
    - Unidirectional Many-To-One (Like in Journey <-- Country )

4. There should be Integrational Tests for each operation: Create, Read, Update, Delete
